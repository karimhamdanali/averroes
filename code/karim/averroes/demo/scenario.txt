Step 1
Introduce yourself, speak a bit about the project (1 minute max).

Step 2
Point out the sign that says the presentation date/time: Thursday July 4th, Session 5 (14:15-15:15pm), last presenation.

Step 3
The DEMO

Step 4
Show the table of benchmarks and tell them let's pick a benchmark that doesn't take long to run, and choose raytrace.
Alternatively, if they ask to run a specific benchmark, by all means do that.

Step 5
Explain while Averroes is running, what each line of the output represents
- Jar organization: sorts out input jars into application & library based on regular expression in properties file
- Loading the classes into Soot
- Creating the class hierarchy
- Cleaning up the hierarchy: removes unnecessary fields, methods, classes
- Generating extra classes: create concrete classes implementations for some library classes (e.g., Vector.elements()
and Enumeration).
- Creating Averroes.class
- Using Soot to validate the internal Jimple structure of placeholder library and generate class files
- Using BCEL to verify the structure of the class files in the generated JAR

Step 6
Use Spark to generate the call graphs for that benchmark, or any other really if they'd like
Have the table for Spark times ready so that they can compare both times.
